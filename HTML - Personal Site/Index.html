        <p><br>A curiosity-driven Mechanical Engineer with experiences spanning across aircraft, manufacturing, and defence industries, via internships and projects, at eminent industries. Key expertise is to design and develop projects on Solidworks, and code for different projects using MATLAB and Python.
            <br><br>During my time at The University of Alabama in Huntsville, I worked on a team project on creating a prototype of a self-stopping sensor system for a vehicle by using an Arduino and an Ultrasonic sensor among other parts. This system included a set of codes to set a minimum distance to stop the vehicle to prevent collision with an incoming object. As the programming head for my group, I worked on coding and data analysis as well as ensuring the correct implementation of the measured data after running through the program. I am currently working on my senior design project where I will be using PATRAN in structural analysis and MSC NASTRAN for post-processing.
            <br><br>My volunteer and work experiences have further enhanced my interpersonal and communication skills, and taught me how to work with, and assist, a variety of individuals. I have demonstrated that I can provide resources and help new incoming students while working as an Orientation Leader. I successfully helped the professor explain the concepts to students outside of class in Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS), receiving a certificate for Experienced PASS Leader. I am also proficient with MATLAB and Python as I have also been working as a Teaching Assistant for these programs. I can speak 5 languages, English, German, Urdu, Punjabi, and Pashto.
